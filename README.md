# 2Km-Powerful-FM-Transmitter-Circuit
The performance and working of the FM transmitter circuit are dependent upon the variable capacitor and inductor. In this article, you are going to learn how you can prepare an FM transmitter circuit and how it works with its various applications.

So as you know today's article we are going to make a Long-range FM transmitter Circuit with minimal Components. The FM transmitter (Frequency modulation) circuit is made up of a single transistor or a BJT. In wireless communication, the (frequency modulation) FM carries the data or information by changing the frequency of the carrier wave as per the information or a message signal.

- Transmitter
- Transmission of radio waves
- Receiver

#### Transmitter:
 The transmitter is an extremely important device, its purpose is to produce radio frequency waves for transmission into space. The important elements of transmitters are as follows:
 
 #### Microphone:
  A microphone is a device that converts sound waves into electrical waves. When the speaker speaks or a musical instrument is played, the varying air pressure generates an audio electrical signal corresponding in frequency to the original signal. The output of the microphone is fed to a multistage amplifier.
  
  #### Audio Amplifier:
  The audio signal from the microphone is quite weak and requires amplification. This job is accomplished by cascaded audio amplifiers. The amplified output from the last audio amplifier is fed to the modulator for rendering the process of modulation.
  
  #### Oscillator:
  The function of an oscillator is to produce a high-frequency signal, called a carrier wave. Usually, a crystal oscillator is used for this purpose. The power level of the carrier wave is raised to a sufficient level by radiofrequency amplifier stages Most broadcasting stations have carrier wave power of several kilowatts. Such high power is necessary for transmitting the signal to the required distances.
  
  #### Modulator: 
  The amplified audio signal and carrier waves are fed to the modulator. Here, the audio signal is superimposed on the carrier wave suitably. The resultant waves are called modulated waves or radio waves and the process is called modulation. The process of modulation permits the transmission of the audio signal at the carrier frequency. As the carrier frequency is very high, therefore, the audio signal can be transmitted over large distances. The radio waves from the transmitter are fed to the transmitting antenna or aerial from where these are radiated into space.

  #### Radio Receiver:
  
 On reaching the receiving antenna, the radio waves induce tiny e.m.f. in it. This small voltage is fed to the radio receiver. Here, the radio waves are first amplified and then the signal is extracted from them by the process of demodulation. The signal is amplified by audio amplifiers and then fed to the speaker for reproduction into sound waves.

Now I hope you know about what is Transmitter, Transmission, radio waves, or receiver.

So for making an FM transmitter circuit I am using a custom-made PCB without PCB it's you can make but it creates some little bit of noise. So if you are thinking about making an FM transmitter circuit then I will highly suggest you make this circuit in PCB.
